## What we're going to talk about

-   AI generally, Dartmouth definition (broad)\
-   Generative AI, and particularly ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer; trained to provide answers to questions by predicting the next word in a sentence)
-   Ethics

---
class: center, middle

## Issues

-   Distinguish Quality assurance (integrity) vs pedagogic impact
-   Normative concerns re: learning
-   Normative concerns re: genAI (regulation, privacy, cognitive bias, commercial impact, intellectual property, invisible labour (e.g. training to remove offensive content), bias reproduction)

## When {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%" background-color="aquamarine"}
-   We need to support students to engage
  -   That involves innovating our teaching
  -   Quality assurance
  -   And teaching standards of academic integrity
-   We need to understand the learning process
-   We also need to have the normative conversations
